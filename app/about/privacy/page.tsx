              When you use the Services, certain information may be shared with other users and the

                When you submit content (such as a post or comment) to the Services, any visitors to

                elect to have modmail forwarded to their email accounts and, as a result, any
                modmail received by these moderators will be subject to the terms and policies of
                the moderator's email provider.

              We may partner with analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to

              As a ResearchHub user, you have choices about how to protect and limit the collection,
              use, and disclosure of information about you.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Accessing Your Information</h3>
            <p>
              You can also request a copy of the personal information ResearchHub maintains about
              you by emailing hello@ResearchHub.com

              You may delete your account information at any time from the user settings page. You
              can also submit a request to delete the personal information ResearchHub maintains
              about you by emailing hello@ResearchHub.com. When you delete your account, your
              profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted
              under that account. Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you

              Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually
              choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please
              note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the
              availability and functionality of our Services.

            <p>
              Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and
              we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services
              that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt-out.

              Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the
              websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is
              no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not
              take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available
              third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the
              collection and use of information about you.

              We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and
              unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use
              HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and
              administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to
              non-public personal information.
            </p>

              business purposes or as required by law.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Users in the European Economic Area have the right to request access to, rectification
              of, or erasure of their personal data; to data portability in certain circumstances;
              to request restriction of processing; to object to processing; and to withdraw consent
              for processing where they have previously provided consent. These rights can be
              exercised using the information provided under "Your Choices" above or as described in
              the "Other Information - Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests" section
              below. EEA users also have the right to lodge a complaint with their local supervisory
              authority.
            </p>
            <p>
              As required by applicable law, we collect and process information about individuals in
              the EEA only where we have legal bases for doing so. Our legal bases depend on the
