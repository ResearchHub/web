This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Development Requirements

- Node.js
- Install the [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension for VS Code

### TypeScript and Code Quality

This project uses strict TypeScript configuration and enforces code quality through pre-commit hooks:

- All TypeScript files are checked for type errors
- Code is automatically formatted with Prettier
- ESLint runs to catch potential issues
- Commits will be blocked if there are any TypeScript errors or linting issues

> Note: Pre-commit hooks are automatically installed when you run `npm install`. No manual setup is required.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
