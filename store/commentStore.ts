I believe 150 is a great value. However, for instance, with the rise in high-quality reviews, three often end up receiving the grants, while other very good reviews are left out, which must be quite frustrating for those who dedicated time to writing them.I think a different approach could be better implemented, such as:\n\n    1-Editors providing feedback to those who did not receive grants, so they can improve in the future.\n\n    2-Offering smaller grants for reviews that weren\'t "EXCELLENT." For example, if two reviews were excellent, they could receive 150 each, while two other reviews that were "OK" and added some value to the process could receive 75 or 100 for one and 50 for another, depending on their contribution.\n\nThis way, all contributions could be better utilized, and no one would feel overlooked.\n',

Relevant, indeed. \n\nYou seems to be passionate with doing this scientific reviews and have dedicated quite a lot of wor hours as per your statement. Out of curiosity, I wonder, would the appeal of doing this peer reviews of scientific manuscript be less interesting if the incentives designated for it is less than what it is now ? e.g., a $25, $50, or $100 USD equiv. of $RSC instead of the current $150. \n\nI am also wondering about the reference "when the quality speaks for itself", can you help me expand a little bit on how I or any other researcher interested in assessing this "quality" in an objective manner can do so. What kind of criteria or metrics you consider the best measure of "quality" ? \n\nAbout the AI labelling aspect of things, which platforms/tools are you using when you check all of your submissions ? maybe you could also kindly share some of the sample report and the link to the posted reviews on RH for us to learn more ?\n\nThe mention about "loyal supporters" also of interest to me, could you help reach out or provide their contact so we could learn a bit more on what aspect of "standard and depth" they appreciate deeply from your works. \n\nThank you for being an active community that try to improve science together. \n',

But if that’s the case, how does that fit with my reviews being AI generated?\n\nThe main reason my reviews were flagged? Speed. I submit reviews quickly because I do this full-time, often working 16-18 hours a day. For me, it’s not about cutting corners—it’s about efficiency and dedication. But apparently, submitting quickly is enough to raise suspicions, even when the quality speaks for itself. AI reports for all of my submissions show my reviews are human written and have the reports.\n\nTo test the system, I ran some of the sample peer reviews recommended by ResearchHub as “best examples” through an AI content detector. Guess what? Some of those “human-written” reviews came back as 100% AI-generated. That’s a huge red flag. If even the gold-standard reviews can be misclassified, how accurate are these tools in evaluating the rest of us?\n',

Couldn\'t it also be interpreted as that those reviewers sending their reviews close to the deadline have had more time to read the paper, think, revise references, and give a review with better quality?. For instance, I would be skeptical of the quality of a peer review submitted within hours of getting the assignment. But there would be a sweet spot that ensures speed but also quality.\n\n\nAnother thought/question I have is, how hard would it be to test the hypotheses of this research with paid peer-reviews of "traditional" journals? Not very well known, but some few journals actually pay a minimum amount of money per review. I think they are  mostly european journals (',

Couldn\'t it also be interpreted as that those reviewers sending their reviews close to the deadline have had more time to read the paper, think, revise references, and give a review with better quality?. For instance, I would be skeptical of the quality of a peer review submitted within hours of getting the assignment. But there would be a sweet spot that ensures speed but also quality.\n\n\nAnother thought/question I have is, how hard would it be to test the hypotheses of this research with paid peer-reviews of "traditional" journals? Not very well known, but some few journals actually pay a minimum amount of money per review. I think they are  mostly european journals (',

                        ", thank you for your questions. Yes, that interpretation that reviewer that submitted late/close to deadline might have more time to read the paper. Personally, I don't make any assumption on this, so I left that out from the discussion. I stick to the data I can objectively intepret as for now. \n\nTo clarify, here in our early campaign, we don't have cases where task were assigned directly to a specific person and payment done right up-front. The whole dynamics will be very different in that case. If things is done this way, the whole incentive to quality relationship/correlation all will depend solely on the decision of whoever approved the reviewer and decided to pay certain price for it. \n\nIn our case here, we put an open peer review bounty with certain designated amount of reward and assessment made after inspecting all received submission after bounty expired. \n\nAlthough not much data available on paid peer review from traditional journals, we do have some of them collected from various places. From what i've seen so far, some of them that are paid up to $450/review is doing really good job. Some other, that got compensated with APC credits (instead of real money) or just a meager $50/review is less in their rigor. \n\nThere are relatively abundant amount of data when it comes to voluntary peer reviews, but the field of study for this peer reviews aren't diverse enough. Most are from a more computer science and technological field, where the culture is more open, also some other comes from digital-empowered sciences. Many of the traditional research/scientific field are still filled with \"elders\" or conservative researchers that are accustomed to doing things the old way, times when publications are still in print form. \n",

                  ", thank you for your questions. Yes, that interpretation that reviewer that submitted late/close to deadline might have more time to read the paper. Personally, I don't make any assumption on this, so I left that out from the discussion. I stick to the data I can objectively intepret as for now. \n\nTo clarify, here in our early campaign, we don't have cases where task were assigned directly to a specific person and payment done right up-front. The whole dynamics will be very different in that case. If things is done this way, the whole incentive to quality relationship/correlation all will depend solely on the decision of whoever approved the reviewer and decided to pay certain price for it. \n\nIn our case here, we put an open peer review bounty with certain designated amount of reward and assessment made after inspecting all received submission after bounty expired. \n\nAlthough not much data available on paid peer review from traditional journals, we do have some of them collected from various places. From what i've seen so far, some of them that are paid up to $450/review is doing really good job. Some other, that got compensated with APC credits (instead of real money) or just a meager $50/review is less in their rigor. \n\nThere are relatively abundant amount of data when it comes to voluntary peer reviews, but the field of study for this peer reviews aren't diverse enough. Most are from a more computer science and technological field, where the culture is more open, also some other comes from digital-empowered sciences. Many of the traditional research/scientific field are still filled with \"elders\" or conservative researchers that are accustomed to doing things the old way, times when publications are still in print form. \n",

Couldn\'t it also be interpreted as that those reviewers sending their reviews close to the deadline have had more time to read the paper, think, revise references, and give a review with better quality?. For instance, I would be skeptical of the quality of a peer review submitted within hours of getting the assignment. But there would be a sweet spot that ensures speed but also quality.\n\n\nAnother thought/question I have is, how hard would it be to test the hypotheses of this research with paid peer-reviews of "traditional" journals? Not very well known, but some few journals actually pay a minimum amount of money per review. I think they are  mostly european journals (',
