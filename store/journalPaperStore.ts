    abstract:
      'This paper highlights a gap in the scientific understanding of the relationship between movement, muscular tension, breathing, the nervous system, and interoception, proposing a novel framework based on previously undefined neuromuscular ‘torque chains’. These torque chains, categorised as internal and external, influence musculoskeletal alignment, autonomic regulation, and emotional processing. Building upon the concept of a functionally integrated biomechanical model of the muscular system, we propose an expanded view that includes nervous system dynamics. By examining the interplay among these systems, this work brings awareness to how targeted interventions—such as breathwork guided by muscular tension and the application of specific movement patterns—can be developed and applied to alleviate chronic pain, improve nervous system regulation, and facilitate somatic-emotional integration. The proposed framework offers potential insights into the mechanisms that link all forms of somatic therapy used for chronic pain and stress-related conditions, encouraging further consideration and formal research.',

    abstract:
      'In the aviation world, Meteorological Aerodrome Report (METAR) is ubiquitous and plays crucial role in ensuring flight safety. The emergence of machine learning (ML) techniques, has now allowed historical weather reports to become more valuable and more meaningful. [1-4] In this study we delve deep into the various features of typical METAR formatted data to then reveals numerous useful insights that helps in weather forecasting for use in aviation. A collection of past METAR data were processed and curated into datasets used for training neural network-based machine learning models for local weather forecasting. The goal of this study is two-fold. First is to meticulously explore relationships across different meteorological data and uncover statistical patterns amongst different factor that influence weather, Second, is to demonstrate the utilization of past historical METAR report data in order to build a fast and predictive machine learning model and AI-driven weather forecast application. The dataset used for this particular study is based on METAR data published by Miami International Airport from January 2014 to December 2023. We believe the insights derived from this study could further empower ML application to make “Flying Safer Around Miami”.',

    abstract:
      'Humans can learn to maintain upright posture across a range of scenarios. For instance, when stepping from shore onto a stand-up paddle (SUP) board, humans adapt to a dynamic support surface that can move through both external factors (i.e., imposed forces from water) and self-generated actions (i.e., forces and torques delivered through the feet). Consequently, the brain must accommodate for the unique mechanical relationships between the body, board and water to stabilize upright whole-body posture. In the present study, we examined how humans balanced on a SUP board in water by analyzing whole-body kinematics of: (1) novices (to aquatic board sports) who trained to balance on the board, and (2) experienced participants who stood at different stance orientations and widths. When on the SUP board, novice and experienced participants exhibited body segment movements that were highly coupled to board motion as well as whole-body movement variability that increased compared to standing on land. During training, however, novice participants progressively reduced the movement variability of their upper body (head and torso) while allowing the board variability to increase. This was accompanied by a reduction in coupling (i.e., cross-correlation) between the body and board movements. When experienced participants stood with the body facing the board’s width (i.e., surfer stance), whole-body movements were more variable as compared to when they faced the board’s length (i.e., SUP stance). Surprisingly, however, wider stance widths were associated with greater movement variability. Our study demonstrates how human movement behavior is adapted for balancing atop a SUP board.',

    abstract:
      'Flavobacterium covae is one of the four Flavobacterium species causing columnaris disease among warm-water fish. Flavobacterium covae strain 94-081 is highly virulent in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) compared to F. columnare strain ATCC 49512. This study focused on analyzing the unique genes present in the genome of F. covae strain 94-081 compared to the genome of F. columnare strain ATCC 49512. Our comparative genome analysis revealed presence of 36 proteins unique to F. covae. Within the unique genes, nine genes (leuA, leuB, leuC, leuD, ilvA, ilvB, ilvC, ilvD, and ilvH) were associated with the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway and seven genes (cysD, cysE, cysG, cysH, cysI, cysK, and cysN) were involved in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway. Among the BCAA biosynthesis-related genes, ilvC (ketol-acid reductoisomerase) and ilvD (dihydroxy-acid dehydratase) showed potential interaction with catfish proteins based on the host-pathogen interaction database analysis. To investigate the functional significance of the BCAA pathway, we generated F. covae leuD (FcΔleuD) and ilvD (FcΔilvD) mutants. The deletion of leuD and ilvD genes did not cause growth defects, but they showed reduced virulence in catfish (47.5% and 70% mortality, respectively) compared to the wild-type strain (FcWT) (100% mortality). This is the first report indicating a potential role of the BCAA pathways in F. covae virulence. Further studies will reveal the role of the cysteine biosynthesis pathway and other unique genes on F. covae virulence.',

    abstract:
      'Background: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is highly effective for degenerative joint disease but poses challenges in younger patients due to higher complication and revision rates. This case highlights the importance of exploring non-surgical approaches that optimise the neuromuscular system thoroughly prior to surgery and reduces the risk of osteoarthritis progression. Case Presentation: A 35-year-old non-competitive weightlifter with chronic hip pain, diagnosed with Otto’s disease and protrusio acetabuli, was scheduled for THA. However, following a personalised neuromuscular approach that primarily focused on psoas muscle retraining, she experienced immediate and sustained reductions in pain and stiffness, leading to cancellation of the surgery. At 2.5 years follow-up, she remains symptomatically improved. Conclusion: This case emphasises the critical role of comprehensive neuromuscular assessment and targeted optimisation of weak and imbalanced muscle groups, in particular the psoas major, before resorting to surgical interventions, especially for younger adults with chronic hip pain.',
